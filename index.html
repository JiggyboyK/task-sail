    <p>This is a symbolic park named after the iconic legend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gani_Fawehinmi">Chief Gani Fawehinmi</a>. A lawyer per excellence and an advocate  for the common man,</p>
    <p>Today, the park service is a melting pot for all struggles emanating in the mega city(Lagos) in <b> <i>2010</i></b>, a park in Ojota was named after him by the <b>Lagos state government</b></p>

    <p>I went to the park to take pictures for my photography assignment. I'm really proud such site of attraction was dedicated to Gani Fawehinmi.He was a man of honor and justice</p>
    <p>The park had beautiful sceneries thought it needs more security because of the Ojota opportunists. It requires maintenence too. But overall I loved it</p>
